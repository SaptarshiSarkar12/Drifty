## Running the Project in IntelliJ IDEA

#### Prerequisites

- [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
- [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#previous-stable-3-8-x-release) and [install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) **Maven** (Maven v3.8.8 is required for building installer or executable binaries for Drifty GUI, locally)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Recommended)

#### Steps

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty.git
   ```
   You'll need to replace `SaptarshiSarkar12` with your GitHub username if you have forked the repository.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Follow the below steps to run the project:
   - Open the `Drifty_CLI` java class in `CLI/src/main/java/main` directory and run the project. This will start the CLI application.
   - Open the `Drifty_GUI` java class in `GUI/src/main/java/main` directory and run the project. This will start the GUI application.

## Building Installer or Executable Binaries for Drifty

### Local Build

#### Prerequisites

- [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
- [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#previous-stable-3-8-x-release) and [install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) **Maven** (Maven v3.8.8 is required for building installer or executable binaries for Drifty GUI, locally)
- [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/) (Optional but required for building executable binaries locally)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) (Optional but required for building executable binaries for Drifty GUI, locally)

#### Steps

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory
2. Run the below command to install the jar files in the local maven repository
   ```shell
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. For Drifty GUI only, you need to build a C object file by running the below command
   - For Linux,
     ```shell
     gcc -c config/missing_symbols.c -o config/missing_symbols-ubuntu-latest.o
     ```
   - For Windows,
     ```shell
     gcc -c config/missing_symbols.c -o config/missing_symbols-windows-latest.o
     ```
   - For Mac,
     ```shell
        gcc -c config/missing_symbols.c -o config/missing_symbols-macos-latest.o
     ```
   Replace `gcc` with the path to the GCC compiler if it is not in the system path.
4. Run the below command to build the installer or executable binaries
   - For GUI,
      - For Linux,
        ```shell
        mvn -P build-drifty-gui-for-ubuntu-latest gluonfx:build gluonfx:package -rf :GUI -U
        ```
      - For Windows,
        ```shell
        mvn -P build-drifty-gui-for-windows-latest gluonfx:build gluonfx:package -rf :GUI -U
        ```
      - For Mac,
        ```shell
        mvn -P build-drifty-gui-for-macos-latest gluonfx:build gluonfx:package -rf :GUI -U
        ```
   - For CLI,
       - For Linux,
         ```shell
         mvn -P build-drifty-cli-for-ubuntu-latest package
         ```
       - For Windows,
         ```shell
         mvn -P build-drifty-cli-for-windows-latest package
         ```
       - For Mac,
         ```shell
         mvn -P build-drifty-cli-for-macos-latest package
         ```
5. Upon completion of the build, the installer or executable binaries will be neatly organized in the directories listed below. The placeholder `{arch}` should be replaced with either `x86_64` or `aarch64`, depending on your system's architecture.
    - For GUI,
      - For Linux,
        ```shell
        GUI/target/gluonfx/{arch}-linux
        ```
      - For Windows,
        ```shell
        GUI/target/gluonfx/{arch}-windows
        ```
      - For Mac,
        ```shell
        GUI/target/gluonfx/{arch}-mac
        ```
    - For CLI,
      - For Linux,
        ```shell
        CLI/target/CLI/linux
        ```
      - For Windows,
        ```shell
        CLI/target/CLI/windows
        ```
      - For Mac,
        ```shell
        CLI/target/CLI/mac
        ```
6. You can now run the installer or executable binaries to use the application.
7. To remove the generated files, run the below command
   ```shell
   mvn clean
   ```
