## Pull Requests

[Pull requests](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/pulls) are a fantastic way to bring your ideas to life in this project! Start by opening an issue to describe your proposed changes and discuss them with the maintainers. Once the issue is assigned to you, you can go ahead and submit your pull request.

### Things to keep in mind while creating a Pull Request

1. Before opening a pull request, please ensure that **each commit is signed off** using the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)** (i.e., by using the `-s{:sh}` or `--signoff{:sh}` flag with `-S{:sh}` or `--gpg-sign{:sh}`). This confirms that _**you have the rights to contribute the code under the project's licensing terms**_. For more information, please see [**GitHub's guide on commit signoffs**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
2. Please ensure that your pull request is **linked to an issue**. If the issue does not exist, please create one.
3. If your task is not yet complete, please mark it as a [**draft** pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#converting-a-pull-request-to-a-draft). This will help the maintainers to understand that the task is still in progress.
4. Please fill out the [**Pull Request Template**](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) while creating a Pull Request. This will help the maintainers to understand the changes you have made and the purpose of the Pull Request.
