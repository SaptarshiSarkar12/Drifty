## Commands

Drifty CLI supports the following commands:

### Help

**Command**: `--help` or `-h`

**Description**: Display the help message with all the available commands and options.

**Usage**:

```bash
drifty --help
```

### Version

**Command**: `--version` or `-v`

**Description**: Display the version of Drifty CLI along with its components.

**Usage**:

### Batch Download

**Command**: `--batch <file>` or `-b <file>`

**Description**: Download multiple files without the need to specify the URL each time. You need to create an YAML file with the list of URLs you want to download. You can also specify the directory and file name for each URL. The YAML file should have the following format:

```yaml
links: ["<URL1>", "<URL2>", "<URL3>", ...]
# Optional: Specify the directory and file name for each URL
fileNames: ["<FileName1>", "<FileName2>", "<FileName3>", ...]
directory: ["<SameDirectoryForAll>"]
directories: ["<Directory1>", "<Directory2>", "<Directory3>", ...]
```

- **links** (**Required**): List of URLs to download.
- **fileNames** (**Optional**): List of file names to save the downloaded files. The order should match the order of URLs. If not specified, the file name will be automatically detected from the URL.
- **directory** or **directories** (**Optional**): Specify the directory where the files will be saved. Use **directory** to save all files in the same directory. Use **directories** to save each file in the corresponding directory specified in the order of URLs. By default, files are saved in the last used directory or the default download directory (`{user_home}/Downloads`) if not specified.

**Example Configuration**:

```yaml
# batch.yaml (You can name the file as you like)
links:
  [
    "https://download.oracle.com/java/22/latest/jdk-22_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBy1zgt0XPc",
  ]
fileNames: ["jdk-22.tar.gz", "What is GitHub?.mp4"]
directories: ["/home/user/Downloads", "/home/user/Videos"]
```

**Usage**:

```bash
drifty --batch batch.yaml
```

### Add links to Queue

**Command**: `--add <URL1> <URL2> ...`

**Description**: Add one or more URLs to the download queue. The URLs will be downloaded sequentially.

**Usage**:

```bash
drifty --add "https://download.oracle.com/java/22/latest/jdk-22_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBy1zgt0XPc"
```

### List links in Queue

**Command**: `--list`

**Description**: List all the URLs in the download queue.

**Usage**:

```

### Remove links from Queue

**Command**: `--remove <index1> <index2> ...` or `--remove all`

**Description**: Remove one or more URLs from the download queue. You can specify the index of the URLs to remove, or use `all` to clear the entire queue.
