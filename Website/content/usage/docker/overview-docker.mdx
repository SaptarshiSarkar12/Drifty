# Drifty in Docker Overview

Docker is a platform that allows you to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Drifty can be run in Docker, which provides an isolated environment for running Drifty without the need to install it directly on your machine. This is particularly useful for testing and development purposes.

Drifty docker images are available for both the **CLI** and **GUI** versions, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs. These images are available on [**GitHub Container Registry**](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12?tab=packages&repo_name=Drifty) and can be pulled and run on any machine that has Docker installed.

## Benefits of Using Drifty in Docker

- **Isolation**: Each Drifty instance (CLI and GUI) runs in its own container, ensuring that dependencies and configurations do not interfere with each other.
- **Portability**: Docker containers can be easily shared and deployed across different environments, making it easy to replicate your setup.
- **Version Control**: You can run different versions of Drifty in separate containers, allowing you to test new features or roll back to previous versions without affecting your main installation.
- **Easy Cleanup**: Containers can be easily stopped and removed, allowing you to clean up your environment without leaving behind any residual files or configurations.

## Conclusion

Using Drifty in Docker provides a flexible and efficient way to manage your Drifty applications. Whether you are a developer, tester, or system administrator, Docker can help you streamline your workflow and improve your productivity. With the benefits of isolation, portability, and easy cleanup, Docker is an excellent choice for running Drifty.
