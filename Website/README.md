# Drifty Web

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Built with Next.js** â€“ Fast, server-rendered React framework.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Styled with Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first approach for easy customization.
- ðŸ“± **Fully Responsive** â€“ Works seamlessly across all devices.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty.git
```

### 2. Navigate into the project directory

```sh
cd Drifty
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

#### Potential Issues & Fixes:

- If you encounter `ERR! could not resolve dependency`, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` before reinstalling:
  ```sh
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  ```
- Ensure you're using the correct Node.js version. You can check your version with:
  ```sh
  node -v
  ```

### 4. Start the development server

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Potential Issues & Fixes:

- If you see an error related to ports being in use, stop any conflicting process:
  ```sh
  lsof -i :3000  # Find the process using port 3000
  kill -9 <PID>   # Replace <PID> with the actual process ID
  ```
- If changes are not reflecting, restart the server and clear Next.js cache:
  ```sh
  rm -rf .next && npm run dev
  ```

This will start the app on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
