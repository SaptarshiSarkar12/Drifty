## About üî•

- [**Drifty**](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/) is an **open-source** interactive **File Downloader system** built using _Java_. 
- It is both available in **Command-line Interface** (_CLI_) and **Graphical User Interface** (_GUI_) mode.

## Demo

See the video below to know how to use the application. For any help, you can open an [`issue`](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/issues/new/choose/).

For **Batch Downloading** via **Drifty CLI**, the path to a YAML file has to be provided to it.
It should have the following structure :
```yaml
links: ["", ""] # [REQUIRED] - Links to the files to be downloaded
# Below parameters are OPTIONAL
fileNames: [""] # Will be auto-retrieved if not provided
# If the directory is not provided, the files will be downloaded in the default downloads folder.
directory: [""] # Use 'directory' when all the files to be downloaded in the same folder.
directories: [""] # Use 'directories' when the download folder is different for each of the files
```

### Using Drifty Application via Docker üêã

> [!TIP]   
> - To download files to a specific local directory, you need to mount that directory as a volume for Drifty.
> For example, if you want to download the file to your `home/username/Downloads` directory, then, you need to use the volume flag `-v /home/username/Downloads:/root/Downloads` with the docker command.
> - You can also mount `-v /home/username/.drifty:/root/.drifty` to enable the docker container to store Drifty's data in your local directory, which will make Drifty initialize much faster üöÄ‚ö°.
> - For **Linux**, we recommend using **Docker Engine** directly instead of running images with **Docker Desktop**. To do this, add **_`sudo`_** before the docker commands.
> - If you want to try unstable (**Alpha** or **Beta**) [**_Alpha releases are not available as of now_**] or the mostly stable versions (**Release Candidate**) [**_Release Candidate releases are not available as of now_**], you need to use the respective docker image tags. For example, to use the **Beta** version of Drifty, you need to use the docker image tag `beta` like `ghcr.io/saptarshisarkar12/drifty-cli:beta` or `ghcr.io/saptarshisarkar12/drifty-gui:beta`.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - To run Drifty GUI docker image, you need to do the following üëá
>     - For **Linux and Windows**, please run `xhost +local:docker` before running the GUI docker image.
>     - For **macOS**, please follow [these instructions](Docker/macOS%20Docker%20Build%20Instructions.md).

1. Pull the Docker image for Drifty using the below command -   
    **For Drifty CLI**,
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/saptarshisarkar12/drifty-cli:master
    ```
    **For Drifty GUI**,
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/saptarshisarkar12/drifty-gui:master
    ```
2. Run the docker image using the below command -   
    **For Drifty CLI**,
    ```bash
    docker run ghcr.io/saptarshisarkar12/drifty-cli:master
    ```
    **For Drifty GUI**,
    ```bash
    docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --net=host -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix ghcr.io/saptarshisarkar12/drifty-gui:master
    ```
3. Drifty will open, and you can now use it üéâ!

### Using Docker üêã for Development

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For **Linux and Windows**, please run `xhost +local:docker` before running the GUI docker image.   
> For **macOS**, please follow [these instructions](Docker/macOS%20Docker%20Build%20Instructions.md) to run Drifty GUI docker image.
