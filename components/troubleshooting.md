# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems or errors while using Drifty, here are some tips on how to resolve them:

## Common errors

- `Invalid URL`: This means that the URL that you entered is not valid or not supported by Drifty. Please check the spelling and format of the URL and make sure that it is a direct link to a file. For example, `https://example.com/file.pdf` is a valid URL, but `https://example.com/page.html` is not.
- `File not found`: This means that the file that you are trying to download does not exist or has been removed from the server. Please check the URL and make sure that the file is still available online.
- `Connection error`: This means that there is a problem with your internet connection or the server that hosts the file. Please check your network settings and try again later.
- `Permission denied`: This means that you do not have the permission to access or write to the directory where you want to save the downloaded files. Please check your user account and folder permissions and make sure that you have enough disk space.
