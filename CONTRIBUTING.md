### Does it state intent ?
You should be _clear_ which problem you're trying to _solve or the feature you want to include_ with your contribution.

For example:

> Added some files

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add files to make the app more user friendly

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.
