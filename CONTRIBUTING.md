The following are the guidelines for contributing to this project:

## How to Report Bugs

Please open a new issue with steps to reproduce the problem you're experiencing.
Provide as much information as possible, including screenshots, text output, and both your expected and actual results.

## How to Request Enhancements

First, please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/issues) section of this project and search [the repository's GitHub issues](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/issues) to make sure that your idea has not been (or is not still) considered.
Then, please [create a new issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/issues/new/choose) describing the enhancement you would like to have.
Be sure to include as much detail as possible including step-by-step descriptions, specific examples, screenshots or mockups, and providing a reason why the enhancement might be worthwhile.

## Quick guide of some common ways to contribute

### Issues

[**Issues**](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/issues/new/choose) are very valuable to this project. Please check if any similar issues are already present. If not, then feel free to open that issue.

- **Feature 💡 Requests** are valuable sources of enhancements which the project can make.
- **Bug 🐞 Reports** show where this project is lacking and errors come up.
- With a **question**, you show where contributors can improve the user experience.

### Projects

[**Projects**](https://github.com/users/SaptarshiSarkar12/projects/3) lists the **tasks _completed_, _in progress_ and _the ideas left to be incorporated_ in the project**. You can work on the **To-Do tasks** by _**creating the issue** (if not present) and **getting yourself assigned**_.

### Pull Requests

[**Pull requests**](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/pulls) are a great way to get your ideas (through code changes) into this project. Please open an issue at first, describing the changes you want to make, then feel free to open a PR (Pull Request).

Before opening a pull request, please ensure that **each commit is signed off** using the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)** (i.e., by using the `-s` or `--signoff` flag with `-S` or `--gpg-sign`). This confirms that _**you have the rights to contribute the code under the project's licensing terms**_. For more information, please see [**GitHub's guide on commit signoffs**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

#### Does it state intent?

You should be _clear_ which problem you're trying to _solve or the feature you want to include_ with your contribution.

For example:

> Added some files

Does not tell me anything about why you're doing that

> feat: Add files to make the app more user-friendly

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.

The use of [**conventional commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is recommended. It is a part of Git Best practices.
You can check some examples of commits [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#examples).
