## Quick guide of some common ways to contribute

### Projects

[**Projects**](https://github.com/users/SaptarshiSarkar12/projects/3) lists the **tasks _completed_, _in progress_ and _the ideas left to be incorporated_ in the project**. You can work on the **To-Do tasks** by _**creating the issue** (if not present) and **getting yourself assigned**_.

### Pull Requests

[**Pull requests**](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/pulls) are a great way to get your ideas (through code changes) into this project. Please open an issue at first, describing the changes you want to make, then feel free to open a PR (Pull Request).

#### Does it state intent?

You should be _clear_ which problem you're trying to _solve or the feature you want to include_ with your contribution.

For example:

> Added some files

Does not tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add files to make the app more user-friendly

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.
